# zpl-canvas
Simple zpl parser and renderer. Defines a custom `<zpl-canvas>` element which can render a preview from basic zpl content. [See demo](https://mrotherguy.github.io/zpl-canvas/)

Note: Many many features are missing and you should definitely not expect the preview to match exactly to what printer would actually output.
